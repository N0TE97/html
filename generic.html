								<p>I was born in Haifa on 27/11/1997. I lived in a small town called Yokneam Elit, Unfortunately at the age of six my parents separated and I moved to live with my mother in Haifa, but my father was always there to help me and guide me to a much better place. From a young age, I really liked everything Regarding computers, whether it's games, or just at the age of seven building a website and playing with HTML, the years have passed and I've tried many things from the field of sports, football, basketball, tennis, swimming, but I realized that all these fields are not mine, I don't really connect with them, but you know if We won't try, we won't know, until I realized that the thing I really like to do in my free time is music, work on software called Ableton and produce and create rap music, over the years I realized that I want to move forward in my life and go study something more serious because today it is very difficult to get by without a profession in hand, So I decided to go study,</p>
								<p>I found a lot of courses regarding cyber information systems, programming, computer science, etc.
								Suddenly I saw another course called, QA (Quality assurance), I started watching a lot of videos on YouTube about this field and asking acquaintances who do work and know the field closely, and I started to be drawn to this thing called QA, because I have always been a person who likes to solve problems, whether it's at home, At work, or even in music, and I know that nothing is perfect in life, but you can always find a solution to any problem, and then I realized that my dream is to become a QA engineer and advance as far as possible and succeed in this field as much as possible, I found an amazing person named Gal Matlon, who helped me move forward To my success at a very crazy pace, and I can say from the bottom of my heart, that I found the field in which I really want to be a real professional and even beyond.</p>
