									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>All my life I've been told that patience and perseverance are the keys to success in many things in life, especially in the world of QA, I understand that without these skills, it will be very difficult to continue to achieve your goals, and that's why I've been working on this ability since a young age.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Ever since I can remember I was a child who always liked to solve puzzles and solve problems in mind games and as much as possible to think outside the box of course I didn't always succeed and it was discouraging but I never gave up on myself and I always continued to challenge myself and I will continue until I succeed in achieving my goals and I think this is a trait Very important for starting QA.

									<p>I have always been a person who loves to work in a team and achieve success together, sometimes crises and misunderstandings happen, but I always find a solution to these problems in order to achieve success together, because when you are in a winning team, nothing will stand in our way.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Throughout my life, I have had changes, some significant and some less, but I have always found a way to manage, whether it is at work, in my studies, or in life, so no matter what happens I am always ready for anything</p>

										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>At school, I studied CNC, and we had many projects and products to submit, I always managed to meet deadlines in submitting projects and delivering products on time, sometimes there were difficulties, but when you don't give up, you get the results you need.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">learning<br />
										</a>agility</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I know how to use a combination of skills to learn, relearn, and easily adapt to changes, many times in my life there were situations where I had to adapt to the workplace or to new changes in the work/study frameworks, and I almost always succeeded in doing so in every job I worked, my understanding of how and what should be done You were always very agile, whether it was in workplaces or in the projects I used to do back when I was studying CNC and I think this is a very important element in order to advance in the world of QA and beyond.	</p>
